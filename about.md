# About Me

This is an example page to demonstrate how to add new pages to your Jekyll site.

## How This Page Was Created

This page was created by adding a new markdown file (`about.md`) in the root directory of the site.

## Key Elements

- **Front matter**: The YAML section at the top defines the layout, title, and permalink
- **Layout**: Uses the `page` layout from the Minima theme
- **Permalink**: Defines the URL path for this page (`/about/`)
- **Content**: Standard markdown content below the front matter

You can create similar pages for:
- Portfolio
- Blog
- Contact
- Projects
- Any other content you want to share
